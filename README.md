# AUTONOMOUS  DRIVING

## Introduction  Overview and Origin
This case study explores how self driving technology is powered by artificial Intelligence (AI)
The concept of autonomous driving dates back several decades, and the technology has evolved through various stages:


## Early Concepts (1950-1980s)

## 1950s: 
The first conceptual steps toward autonomous driving were explored. General Motors (GM) showcased a vision for autonomous driving at its 1939 "Futurama" exhibit at the New York World’s Fair, imagining automated highways.

## 1977:
The Japanese engineer Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Lab developed an early prototype of an autonomous car. This vehicle followed white street markings using analog computer processing, achieving speeds up to 30 km/h (19 mph).

## 2. The DARPA Challenges (2000s)
A major milestone in autonomous driving came from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a research wing of the U.S. Department of Defense, which held two challenges in the early 2000s that greatly accelerated development:

## 2004 DARPA Grand Challenge: 
In this competition, autonomous vehicles attempted to navigate a 142-mile off-road course. None of the vehicles completed the challenge, but it laid the groundwork for rapid advancements.

## 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge: 
In the second competition, several vehicles completed the course. Stanley, a vehicle developed by Stanford University, won by successfully navigating the entire route. This success spurred significant interest and investment in autonomous driving.

## 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge: 
This challenge shifted focus to urban environments, requiring vehicles to navigate city streets with traffic. Carnegie Mellon University’s vehicle won the challenge, demonstrating significant improvements in autonomous technology.
These challenges marked the beginning of serious advancements in self-driving technology, particularly in navigation, computer vision, and sensor fusion.

## 3. Technological Advancements (2010s)
During the 2010s, major advancements in AI, sensor technology, and computing power led to significant improvements in autonomous driving systems. Companies like Google (Waymo), Tesla, Uber, and traditional automakers began making serious investments in self-driving research and development.

## Google’s Waymo (2009): 
Google launched its self-driving car project in 2009, which later became Waymo. By 2012, Waymo’s autonomous vehicles had completed 300,000 miles of autonomous driving with no accidents under specific conditions.

## Tesla Autopilot (2014): 
Tesla introduced its Autopilot system in 2014, offering semi-autonomous driving features, such as adaptive cruise control, lane centering, and self-parking. This system marked a significant step toward consumer adoption of partial autonomy.
During this period, key technologies emerged:

## LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging): 
LIDAR sensors provide high-resolution 3D maps of the environment, allowing autonomous systems to detect obstacles and navigate more effectively.
•	Machine Learning and Neural Networks: AI models, particularly deep learning, became critical for tasks like object detection, image recognition, and decision-making in real time.
