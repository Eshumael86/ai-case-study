## Introduction  Overview and Origin 
This case study explores how self driving technology is powered by artificial Intelligence (AI) and how TESLA INC is uses this technology to stay ahead of competitors.
The concept of autonomous driving dates back several decades, and the technology has evolved through various stages:


## Early Concepts (1950-1980s)

#### 1950s: 
The first conceptual steps toward autonomous driving were explored. General Motors (GM) showcased a vision for autonomous driving at its 1939 "Futurama" exhibit at the New York World’s Fair, imagining automated highways.

#### 1977:
The Japanese engineer Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Lab developed an early prototype of an autonomous car. This vehicle followed white street markings using analog computer processing, achieving speeds up to 30 km/h (19 mph).

#### 2. The DARPA Challenges (2000s)
A major milestone in autonomous driving came from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a research wing of the U.S. Department of Defense, which held two challenges in the early 2000s that greatly accelerated development:

#### 2004 DARPA Grand Challenge: 
In this competition, autonomous vehicles attempted to navigate a 142-mile off-road course. None of the vehicles completed the challenge, but it laid the groundwork for rapid advancements.

#### 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge: 
In the second competition, several vehicles completed the course. Stanley, a vehicle developed by Stanford University, won by successfully navigating the entire route. This success spurred significant interest and investment in autonomous driving.

#### 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge: 
This challenge shifted focus to urban environments, requiring vehicles to navigate city streets with traffic. Carnegie Mellon University’s vehicle won the challenge, demonstrating significant improvements in autonomous technology.
These challenges marked the beginning of serious advancements in self-driving technology, particularly in navigation, computer vision, and sensor fusion.

## 3. Technological Advancements (2010s)
During the 2010s, major advancements in AI, sensor technology, and computing power led to significant improvements in autonomous driving systems. Companies like Google (Waymo), Tesla, Uber, and traditional automakers began making serious investments in self-driving research and development.

#### Google’s Waymo (2009): 
Google launched its self-driving car project in 2009, which later became Waymo. By 2012, Waymo’s autonomous vehicles had completed 300,000 miles of autonomous driving with no accidents under specific conditions.

#### Tesla Autopilot (2014): 
Tesla introduced its Autopilot system in 2014, offering semi-autonomous driving features, such as adaptive cruise control, lane centering, and self-parking. This system marked a significant step toward consumer adoption of partial autonomy.
During this period, key technologies emerged:

#### LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging): 
sensors provide high-resolution 3D maps of the environment, allowing autonomous systems to detect obstacles and navigate more effectively.
•	Machine Learning and Neural Networks: AI models, particularly deep learning, became critical for tasks like object detection, image recognition, and decision-making in real time.

# TESLA'S PLAID TECHNOLOGY 
Since Track Mode was launched in 2018 on Model 3 Performance, we have taken advantage of instant motor torque to make cornering on the track feel as natural as forward acceleration.
Plaid Track Mode is rolling out to Model S Plaid vehicles across North America. With Plaid Track Mode our goals were simple: achieve the quickest lap time for a production electric vehicle at Germany’s Nürburgring, and allow individual adjustability of stability control, handling balance and regenerative braking to give drivers more authority over vehicle control at the racetrack.Plaid Track Mode was developed to take full advantage of our tri-motor platform and more than 1,000 horsepower on tap, with features including:

##### Optimized Powertrain Cooling
Track driving generates an enormous amount of heat in the battery, motors, and brakes. Maximum track endurance is achieved by managing this heat to keep these components as cool as possible.
•	When Plaid Track Mode is engaged, we drop the temperature of the battery pack and motors to create a significant amount of chilled thermal mass. Once track driving begins and heat is generated, shared coolant loops between the battery and motors keep the entire system cooler for longer.
•	We also increase regenerative braking power, which has three major benefits: re-capture more energy during deceleration, reduce load on the friction brakes for better thermal management, and give the driver better modulation and controllability with a single pedal.

##### Lateral Torque Vectoring
Using the same foundation as Model 3 Track Mode, Plaid Track Mode relies heavily on front and rear motors to command rotation: additional torque applied to the rear axle helps turn the nose of the car into a corner; torque applied to the front axle arrests rotation to pull the car straight.
•	Building on this principle, Model S Plaid’s dual rear motors enable full lateral torque vectoring. With Track Mode activated, Plaid automatically adjusts torque split across the rear wheels, independently, which applies a torque bias to rotate the car through turns; this increases turn-in response, improves on-center steering feel, and delivers even greater yaw control throughout a corner.
•	Compared to traditional open- and limited-slip differentials, which must always compete between turn-in response and maximum traction, our electric motors adjust in milliseconds to give the driver both strengths simultaneously, allowing for faster turn-in, increased cornering speeds, and harder acceleration on corner exit.

##### Adjustable Vehicle Dynamics
During normal road driving, our stability control systems are optimized to limit tire slippage and maximize grip to keep the driver safe.
•	In Plaid Track Mode, stability controls enter a race tuning to give the driver maximum control over the car’s lateral movement. With Plaid Track Mode engaged, Tesla’s Vehicle Dynamics Controller (VDC) evaluates steering angle, accelerator, and brake pedal inputs to determine where the driver wants to place the car and will permit tire slippage and automatically adjust torque split to give the driver even more authority and improved agility during high-speed cornering.
•	For drivers who want additional adjustability over vehicle dynamics, handling balance, stability assist and regenerative braking can be changed independently based on their skill level and preferences.

##### Adaptive Suspension Damping
When Plaid Track Mode is engaged, adaptive suspension damping is optimized for track handling: reduced pitch during hard braking and fast acceleration, rebalanced damping to improve responsiveness, and faster settling of vehicle disturbances over bumpy segments to increase driver confidence. To facilitate consistent dynamic driving, ride height is set to Low on drive-off, and the suspension will no longer automatically raise to improve comfort.
